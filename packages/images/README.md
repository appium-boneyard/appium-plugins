# Appium Images Plugin

This is an official Appium plugin designed to facilitate image comparison, visual testing, and image-based functional testing.

## Features

1. **Image Comparison** ([docs](./docs/image-comparison.md)) - A new Appium command and route that allows sending in two different images and comparing them in various ways.
2. **Finding Elements by Image** ([docs](./docs/find-by-image.md)) - Using a template image, find a matching screen region of an app and interact with it via standard Appium element semantics.

## Prerequisites

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) 3.x native libraries
* [opencv4nodejs](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/opencv4nodejs) NPM module: install with `npm i -g opencv4nodejs`. By default the preinstall script of this module also downloads and makes all the required OpenCV libs from source, but this requires developer tools to be available on the host system.
* Appium Server 2.0+

## Installation - Server

Install the plugin using Appium's plugin CLI:

```
appium plugin install images
```

## Installation - Client

No special action is needed to make the features available in the various Appium clients, as this plugin used to be a core Appium feature and its commands are already supported in the official clients.

## Activation

The plugin will not be active unless turned on when invoking the Appium server:

```
appium --use-plugins=images
```

## Usage

Check the docs links above for usage for each of the features provided.
