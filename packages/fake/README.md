# Appium Fake Plugin

This is a "fake" Appium 2.0 plugin used for testing and examples. There's no point in documenting its functionality since it's not meant to be used. If you're here at all, it's probably because you want to peek at the source code to see how a plugin is designed. So go ahead and do that!
