# Appium Universal XML Plugin

This is an official Appium plugin designed to make XML source retrieved from iOS and Android use the same node and attribute names, to facilitate cross-platform test writing.

## Installation - Client

No special action is needed to make the features available in the various Appium clients, as this plugin simply alters the behavior of the existing "get page source" and "find element" methods.

## Activation

The plugin will not be active unless turned on when invoking the Appium server:

```
appium --use-plugins=universal-xml
```
